#![feature(generic_const_exprs)]

//! Ergonomics & safety focused deep learning in Rust. Main features include:
//! 1. Tensor library, complete with const generic shapes, activation functions, and more.
//! 2. Safe & Easy to use neural network building blocks.
//! 3. Standard deep learning optimizers such as Sgd and Adam.
//! 4. Reverse mode auto differentiation[1] implementation.
